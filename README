gandalf.py is a simple reverse and strip script. This script takes as many strings as you want, then reverses them and compares the characters in each posiiton. The final output is a single string of the cleaned up string. 

Special notes:
-Hitting enter on the prompt will end the script and output the results.
-This is only good for equal length strings at the moment
See example below:

└─$ python3 reverse.py
Enter string to reverse (enter to print results): eciqn
Enter string to reverse (enter to print results): ecion
Enter string to reverse (enter to print results): ecien
Enter string to reverse (enter to print results): ecipn
Enter string to reverse (enter to print results): 
The strings reverse are:
nqice
noice
neice
npice

The unique string from all of them is: 
nice
